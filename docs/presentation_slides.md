# YouTube Analytics Project
## End-to-End Data Solution with Snowflake

---

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Build an end-to-end analytics solution for YouTube video statistics
- **Data Source**: YouTube video statistics dataset
- **Technology**: Snowflake as the core data platform
- **Deliverables**: 
  - Data pipeline for ingestion and transformation
  - Star schema dimensional model
  - Analytics views for business insights
  - Multi-environment support (Dev, Test, Prod)
  - Visualization dashboards

---

## Architecture Overview

```
[See architecture_diagram.txt for detailed diagram]
```

Key Components:
- Data ingestion from multiple sources
- ELT processing in Snowflake
- Multi-layer data architecture
- Analytics views for business insights
- Visualization with Snowsight/ThoughtSpot
- CI/CD pipeline for deployment

---

## Data Model

**Star Schema Design**

Fact Table:
- FACT_VIDEO_STATS (views, likes, dislikes, comments)

Dimension Tables:
- DIM_VIDEO (video metadata)
- DIM_CATEGORY (video categories)
- DIM_DATE (date dimension)

Benefits:
- Optimized for analytical queries
- Simplified business reporting
- Improved query performance

---

## Analytics Views

Five key analytics views created:

1. **TOP_VIDEOS_BY_CATEGORY**
   - Top 10 viewed videos by each category

2. **MOST_DISLIKED_VIDEOS**
   - 5 overall most disliked videos

3. **AUTO_CATEGORY_LIKES**
   - Average likes in 'Autos & Vehicles' category

4. **TOP_CATEGORIES_VIDEOS_2014_2018**
   - Videos in top categories by likes (2014-2018)

5. **VIDEO_COUNTS_BY_SOURCE**
   - Video counts by file name and load date

---

## Multi-Environment Support

**Environment Strategy**

Three distinct environments:
- Development (DEV)
- Testing (TEST)
- Production (PROD)

Each environment includes:
- Dedicated database
- Role-based access control
- Environment-specific warehouses
- Consistent schema structure

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Automated Deployment Process**

GitHub Actions workflow:
1. **Validate**: SQL linting and syntax checking
2. **Test**: Automated testing of SQL scripts
3. **Deploy to DEV**: Automatic deployment to development
4. **Deploy to TEST**: Promotion to test environment
5. **Deploy to PROD**: Controlled deployment to production

Benefits:
- Consistent deployments
- Reduced manual errors
- Automated testing
- Controlled promotion

## Change Management

**Process Flow**

1. **Development**:
   - Create feature branch
   - Develop and test locally
   - Submit pull request

2. **Testing**:
   - Automated deployment to TEST
   - Run automated tests
   - Manual validation

3. **Production**:
   - Create release branch
   - Final QA
   - Deploy to PROD

## Visualization & Dashboards

**Dashboard Components**

1. **Category Performance Dashboard**
   - Top videos by category
   - Category comparison metrics

2. **Video Engagement Dashboard**
   - Most disliked videos
   - Engagement metrics analysis

3. **Historical Trends Dashboard**
   - Year-over-year analysis (2014-2018)
   - Category performance over time

4. **Data Quality Dashboard**
   - Source file metrics
   - Data loading statistics

---

## Data Quality Approach

**Quality Assurance Measures**

- Automated data quality checks
- Validation of business rules
- Monitoring of key metrics
- Alerting for anomalies
- Logging of pipeline execution

Implementation:
- Tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Quality checks in transformation process
- Monitoring dashboards

---

## Deployment Strategy

**Zero-Downtime Deployments**

Techniques used:
- Snowflake's zero-copy cloning
- Backward-compatible schema changes
- View swapping for seamless updates
- Task suspension during updates

Rollback strategy:
- Database snapshots before changes
- Version tracking in metadata tables
- Automated rollback scripts

---

## Demo: Snowsight Dashboard

**Live Dashboard Demo**
